					The Internet's Largest Bookstore

					Taking advantage of vast warehouses across the United States, we stock over 1 million titles for 
					immediate delivery -- that's more titles than any other online bookseller. With so many titles, it is vital
					 to give customers an easy way to find precisely the books they are looking for. 
					 Our search engine enables customers to locate books by title, author, or keyword in a few seconds at most. 
					 Customers with a general idea of what they want can use our Browse pages to sift through hundreds of categories 
					 to find exactly the right book. To further assist users, we offer descriptions and reviews, and our See Inside 
					 program lets customers read excerpts from tens of thousands of titles. 
					 We also offer editor recommendations and customer reviews on hundreds of thousands of titles.
					We offers millions of new and used items from a network of trusted Sellers, often at discounted prices. 
					Our special collection of Rare & Collectible Books features unique finds such as signed and first editions and out of print books.
					
					
					Our Members get Unlimited Free Member Express Shipping in 3 days or less on eligible orders. Non-members can get Free Shipping on orders of $25 or more of eligible items. We even offer Same Day Delivery to Manhattan at no extra charge.
